##  ABSTRACT :

The ongoing conflict in Gaza has led to a severe shortage of essential medicines, making it difficult for patients to access the necessary treatments. In addition, the problem of overcrowding in pharmacies has worsened, delaying services and increasing the suffering of patients who urgently need medicines. To address these urgent issues, this project aims to develop an e-pharmacy application that facilitates the process of purchasing and delivering medicines efficiently. The main objective of this project is to ensure the availability of all types of medicines through cooperation with humanitarian organizations and the Ministry of Health. Through this cooperation, the application will provide a wide range of pharmaceutical products, including painkillers, moisturizers, creams, hair care products, skin care products, and others. The application provides an easy-to-use user interface, allowing customers to browse products, order medicines, and receive them at their doorstep, reducing the need to visit pharmacies and limiting the risks of overcrowding and other security risks. As a result, the e-pharmacy bridges the gap in the availability of medicines, ensuring that users receive the required medicines in a timely manner without facing shortages or long queues. This solution greatly enhances access to healthcare in times of crisis, making it an essential tool for patients and healthcare providers alike.


In conclusion, this project offers an innovative and practical solution to the challenges associated with drug shortages and overcrowded pharmacies.
